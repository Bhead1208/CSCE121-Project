Attributes:
Vector of Patrons
Vector of Transactions
Money object for the banks money
Methods:
getTotalMoney():
No arguements. For every Patron, loops through the patron vector, grabing 
all the money values and adding them all into a sum variable,  also adding
the lone money object's value. Return sum when done.
Constructor:
No arguements, ask for a file, and if file does not exist or entry is blank,
create a bank object with a money value of 6000 USD. Else, the Bank should
initialize through the file. Next, the bank should excute menu().
menu():
Most of this function will be a switch statement encased in a while loop, with
the exit option exiting the while loop. In the switch statement, the different 
options will lead to different functions being executed, like getTotalMoney()
and Withdrawal(). After the while loop, the user is asked if they want to save
the file, and if they do, promt them for a name. Then, save the file.
Withdrawal():
Asks for a patron ID and, if they exist, create a transaction object with the
attributes the patron object (reference) and "Withdrawal."
Deposit():
Asks for a patron ID and, if they exist, create a transaction object with the
attributes the patron object (reference) and "Deposit."
newPatron():
Creates a new patron object and places them in the vector, first checking if
their name is already in the bank.
getTransactions():
Loops through the transaction vector, displaying all of them.
getPatrons():
Loops through the patrons vector, displaying all of them.

How to read/save the mega file:
The file that will contain all of the bank objects' information will instead 
contain the names of the files that actually contain the info.
